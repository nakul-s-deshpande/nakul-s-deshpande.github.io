Nakul Deshpande is a postdoctoral research scholar at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he works within at the interface of geomorphology and soft-matter physics. He earned his Ph.D. in Earth & Environmental Science from the University of Pennsylvania, where his research focused on the mechanics of slow, granular deformation in natural landscapes.

His work integrates field observations, physical modeling, and laboratory experiments to better understand the dynamics of hillslope creep and the emergent behavior of disordered materials in geomorphic contexts. His dissertation research culminated in a study published in Nature Communications titled "The Perpetual Fragility of Creeping Hillslopes," which was subsequently featured in The New York Times.

Deshpande’s broader research interests lie in the material physics of landscapes—how the flow and failure of earth materials shape terrain over time. His interdisciplinary approach reflects a commitment to bridging Earth science with physical theory, especially in domains where classical models of stability and failure fall short.
